# File Transfer

File Transfer is a program that will allow the
users to **SEND** and **RECEIVE** files from their 
PC/ Laptop to another PC/ Laptop with ease. It is a cross-platform 
file transferring. 

It is easy to find software to send files from one Phone
to anoher, or from Phone to PC, but software to transfer files
from one PC to another, hardly exists, and even if they do
exists, they either paid or hard to use or both.

Which is why I created this program, which you can use for free,
even modify it as per your needs.

## Getting Started
This is not a python module, but an end-user program. The source 
code is available here, you can simply download it use it. But for 
Windows users, you can either download python from 
[here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Python is already installed on
Linux/ macOS systems, also, this script is compatible with both, Python 3.x and 2.x.

For Windows users, you can download this source code and download Python with it,
or you can also download the executable file from [here](Link-to-be-added-soon).
