# File Transfer

File Transfer is a program that will allow the
users to **SEND** and **RECEIVE** files from their 
PC/ Laptop to another PC/ Laptop with ease. It is a cross-platform 
file transferring. 

It is easy to find software to send files from one Phone
to anoher, or from Phone to PC, but software to transfer files
from one PC to another, hardly exists, and even if they do
exists, they either paid or hard to use or both.

Which is why I created this program, which you can use for free,
even modify it as per your needs.

## Getting Started
This is not a python module, but an end-user program. The source 
code is available here, you can simply download it use it. 

For ***Linux / macOS*** - You have to download the source code
from here and run ```main.py```. It is compatible for Python 2 & 3
which comes pre-installed on both systems. 

For ***Windows*** - Python is not pre-installed on Windows, so you have
to download it
